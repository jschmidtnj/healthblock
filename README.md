A blockchain EHR application

THis application was created using hyperledger, which is a distributed blockchain hosted by the linux foundation. Specifically, hyperledger fabric was used, which was developed by IBM for accellerating development. The backend api is fully functioning, and the frontend website is still under development. See http://datacare.ml/ for the frontend, http://datacarebackend.ml/, and http://35.196.99.211/explorer/ for the REST API.

Thank you.
